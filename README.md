# intro
We have to annotate the genes and charactarize the predicted proteins, all this from a file with a DNA sequence of an organism we don't know. We will aproach this project identifying orthologous proteins through BLAST searches and employing both ab initio and homology-based tools.

This project was conducted by the group: Daria Lunina, Lucía Salgado, Aina Grané and Òscar Miguel
